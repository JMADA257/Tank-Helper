# Tank-Helper


This will be a react native project, primarly for military members in the tank community. My goal with this is to help users who are going to tank school figure out AFVID easier. I compare it to my time in tank school and learning what key notes to look for on military vehicles took me a long time. The mvp for this project will be to have multiple vehicles from multiple countries with pictures that will show the key attributes for those vehicles. Also i would like to add a quizx section that will mock what the military uses to pass afvid courses.
